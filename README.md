# OpenFOAM-cases

This repository has different conjugate heat transfer cases simulated on OpenFOAM5 with the help of its many utilities, including some user defined utilities like pyfoam. The repository is divided into multiple folders each containing a specific simulation. The physical phenomenon that we are trying to understand and simulate is that of heat transfer inside a breast with malignant tissue (tumor). Although its the same phenomenon that is simulated in each of these cases, the requirements in terms of pre-processing, solver definitions and post processing are different, thus giving me many opportunities to learn and use different OpenFOAM utilities and many features of paraview.

The cases published here are the rough works which I carried out during my understanding of OpenFOAM and my work at any organization has not been published.
